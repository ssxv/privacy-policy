## Tiles Launcher: Privacy policy

Welcome to the Tiles Launcher app for Android!

This app is developed by Satyendra Singh.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously.
I know how frustrating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

### Data collected by the app

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data created by the user is stored locally in your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it. No analytics software is present in the app either.

### Explanation of permissions requested in the app

<hr style="border:1px solid gray">

| Permission | Why it is required |
| :---: | --- |
| `android.permission.QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES` | Introduced in API level 30, this permission allows the app to get list of all the installed apps on your device. Which is used to display the list of installed apps on the App drawer section of the app. |

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email, and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,  
Satyendra Singh.
